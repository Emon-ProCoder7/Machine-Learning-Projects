# **KNN Classification Models**  

## 01. Breast Cancer Classification

  In this project, I have build a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier that is trained to predict whether a patient has benign or malignant breast cancer.
  
### Project Goals:
  
   - My model would classify Benign & Malignant Breast Cancer with highest accuracy.

# **Decision Trees and Random Forest**  


## 01. Predicting Income with Random Forest

  In this project, I will be using a dataset containing census information from [UCI’s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).
By using this census data with a random forest, I will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than 50,000 Dollar.

## 02. Guessing Continent From Flag Color

  What are some of the features that would provide clue for defining **Continent** of a country from just their **flag**? Maybe some of the ***colors*** are good indicators. The presence or absence of certain ***shapes*** could provide a hint.

In this project, I've used decision trees to try to predict the continent of flags based on several of these features.The Flag Attribute Information for this dataset is from [UCI’s Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags).

### Project Goals:
  
   - From which **Continent** the ***Flag***☝🏻 is from ?

# **Regression Models**  

## 01. Feature Engineering

  Here I've deployed single, double and multiple features linear regression models, for feature selection and model tuning.
  
### Project Goals:
  
   tennis_stats.csv is data from the men’s professional tennis league, which is called the [ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals)](https://www.atptour.com/). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.
  
  - To determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

## 02. Titanic Survival Prediction

  In this project I've build Regression model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on features.The data I'll be using for training the model is provided by [Kaggle Titanic competition!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
  
### Project Goals:
  
   Predicting what happened to:
  
   - 3rd class passenger `Jack`, 
   - 1st class passenger `Rose` and
   - 3rd class youngest passenger onboard `Millvina Dean`

## 03. Prediction of Future Production

  The **Honeybees** are in a precarious state right now. There have been articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. This project is to investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.
  
  DataFrame about honey production in the United States is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
