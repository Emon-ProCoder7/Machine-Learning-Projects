# **Regression Models**  

## Feature Engineering

  Here I've deployed single, double and multiple features linear regression models, for feature selection and model tuning.
  
### Project Goals:
  
   tennis_stats.csv is data from the menâ€™s professional tennis league, which is called the [ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals)](https://www.atptour.com/). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.
  
  - To determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

## Prediction of Future Production

  The **Honeybees** are in a precarious state right now. There have been articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. This project is to investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.
  
  DataFrame about honey production in the United States is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
